# MAT257 Notes

My notes from MAT257: Analysis II (LEC0101, Professor Edward Bierstone) in LaTeX, as taken in 2018-2019. Warning: may be incomplete/incorrect!

Current MAT257 students: you probably want to look at the file `mat257.pdf` in the folder `transcription`. `notes` is mainly historical, and is much less complete!
